**NOTE**: This repository is in maintenance mode. Bug fixes will continue to be
applied, but no new features will be implemented. To replace this agent, we
recommend you to [migrate to the OpenTelemetry Go API and
SDK](https://www.elastic.co/blog/elastic-go-apm-agent-to-opentelemetry-go-sdk),
which provides similar features. In order to help you do a seamless migration,
we recommend using our [OpenTelemetry
Bridge](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/agent/go/current/opentelemetry.html).
Please refer to the blog post above for further details.
