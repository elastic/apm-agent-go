== Troubleshooting

Is something not working as expected?
Don't worry if you can't figure out what the problem is; weâ€™re here to help!
As a first step, ensure your app is compatible with the Agent's <<supported-tech,supported technologies>>.

If you're an existing Elastic customer with a support contract, please create a ticket in the
https://support.elastic.co/customers/s/login/[Elastic Support portal].
Other users can post in the https://discuss.elastic.co/c/apm[APM discuss forum].

IMPORTANT: *Please attach your debug logs* so that we can analyze the problem.
Upload the *complete* logs to a service like https://gist.github.com.
The logs should include everything from the time the application starts up until the first request has been executed.

=== Disable the Agent

In the unlikely event the Agent causes disruptions to a production application,
you can disable the Agent while you troubleshoot.

If you have access to <<dynamic-configuration,dynamic configuration>>,
you can disable the recording of events by setting <<config-recording,`ELASTIC_APM_RECORDING`>> to `false`.
When changed at runtime from a supported source, there's no need to redeploy your application for the change to take effect.

If that doesn't work, or you don't have access to dynamic configuration, you can disable the Agent by setting
<<config-active,`ELASTIC_APM_ACTIVE`>> to `false`.
You'll need to restart your application for the changes to apply.
