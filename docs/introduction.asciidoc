== Introduction

Welcome to the Elastic APM Go Agent docs.

The Go agent enables you to trace the execution of operations in your https://golang.org/[Go]
applications, sending performance metrics and errors to the Elastic APM server.

The Go agent has built-in support for many popular Go web frameworks and toolkits
such as http://www.gorillatoolkit.org/[Gorilla] and https://gin-gonic.github.io/gin/[Gin],
as well as support for instrumenting Go's built-in https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/[net/http],
https://golang.org/pkg/database/sql/[database/sql] drivers, and APIs for custom instrumentation.

The agent is only one of multiple components you need to get started with APM.
Please also have a look at the documentation for
