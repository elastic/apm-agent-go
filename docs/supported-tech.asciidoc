== Supported Technologies

This page describes the technologies supported by the Elastic APM Go agent.

If your favorite technology is not supported yet, you can vote for it by
participating in our https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScbW7D8m-otPO7cxqeg7XstWR8vMnxG6brnXLs_TFVSTHuHvg/viewform?usp=sf_link[survey], or joining the conversation in the https://discuss.elastic.co/c/apm[Discuss forum].
We will use the results of the survey and Discuss topics to add support
for the most requested technologies.

If you would like to get more involved, take a look at the <<contributing, contributing guide>>.

[float]
[[supported-tech-go]]
=== Go

The Elastic APM Go agent naturally requires Go. We will support, at a minimum,
the last two major Go releases as described by
https://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html#policy[Go's Release Policy]. Older
versions of Go will be supported on a best-effort basis.

We currently test the agent with all major versions of Go since 1.8. Some
integration modules may require a more recent version of Go due to third-party
dependencies.

[float]
[[supported-tech-web-frameworks]]
=== Web Frameworks

We support several third-party web frameworks, as well as Go's standard `net/http`
package. Regardless of the framework, we create a transaction for each incoming
request, and name the transaction after the registered route.

[float]
==== httprouter

https://github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter[julienschmidt/httprouter] does
not use semantic versioning, but its API is relatively stable. Any recent
version should be compatible with the Elastic APM Go agent.

See <<builtin-modules-apmhttprouter, module/apmhttprouter>> for more
information about httprouter instrumentation.

[float]
==== Echo

We support the https://echo.labstack.com/[Echo] web framework,
https://github.com/labstack/echo/releases/tag/3.3.2[v3.2.2] and greater.

See <<builtin-modules-apmecho, module/apmecho>> for more information
about Echo instrumentation.

[float]
==== Gin

We support the https://gin-gonic.github.io/gin/[Gin] web framework,
https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/releases/tag/v1.2[v1.2] and greater.

See <<builtin-modules-apmgin, module/apmgin>> for more information
about Gin instrumentation.

[float]
==== gorilla/mux

We support http://www.gorillatoolkit.org/pkg/mux[gorilla/mux]
https://github.com/gorilla/mux/releases/tag/v1.6.1[v1.6.1] and greater.
Older versions are not supported due to the use of gorilla.Middleware.

See <<builtin-modules-apmgorilla, module/apmgorilla>> for more information
about gorilla/mux instrumentation.

[float]
==== go-restful

We support https://github.com/emicklei/go-restful[go-restful],
https://github.com/emicklei/go-restful/releases/tag/2.0.0[2.0.0] and greater.

See <<builtin-modules-apmrestful, module/apmrestful>> for more information
about go-restful instrumentation.

[float]
[[supported-tech-databases]]
=== Databases

[float]
==== database/sql

We support tracing requests with any `database/sql` driver, provided
the driver is registered with the Elastic APM Go agent. Spans will be
created for each statemented executed.

When using one of the following drivers, the Elastic APM Go agent will
be able to parse the datasource name, and provide more context in the
spans it emits:

- https://github.com/lib/pq[lib/pq] (PostgreSQL)
- https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql[go-sql-driver/mysql]
- https://github.com/go-sqlite3[mattn/go-sqlite3]

See <<builtin-modules-apmsql, module/apmsql>> for more information
about database/sql instrumentation.

[float]
==== GORM

We support the http://gorm.io/[GORM] object-relational mapping library,
https://github.com/jinzhu/gorm/releases/tag/v1.9[v1.9] and greater.
Spans will be created for each create, query, update, and delete
operation.

As with `database/sql` support we provide additional support for the
postgres, mysql, and sqlite dialects.

See <<builtin-modules-apmgorm, module/apmgorm>> for more information
about GORM instrumentation.

[float]
==== Cassandra (gocql)

https://gocql.github.io/[GoCQL] does not have a stable API, so we will
provide support for the most recent API, and older versions of the API
on a best-effort basis. Spans will be created for each query. When the
batch API is used, a span will be created for the batch, and a sub-span
is created for each query in the batch.

See <<builtin-modules-apmgocql, module/apmgocql>> for more information
about GoCQL instrumentation.

[float]
==== Redis (gomodule/redigo)

We support https://github.com/gomodule/redigo[Redigo],
https://github.com/gomodule/redigo/tree/v2.0.0[v2.0.0] and greater.
We provide helper functions for reporting Redis commands as spans.

See <<builtin-modules-apmredigo, module/apmredigo>> for more information
about Redigo instrumentation.

[float]
[[supported-tech-rpc]]
=== RPC Frameworks

[float]
==== gRPC

We support https://grpc.io/[gRPC]
https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/releases/tag/v1.3.0[v1.3.0] and greater.
We provide unary interceptors for both the client and server. The server
interceptor will create a transaction for each incoming request, and
the client interceptor will create a span for each outgoing request.

See <<builtin-modules-apmgrpc, module/apmgrpc>> for more information
about gRPC instrumentation.
