// Package apmgokit provides examples and integration tests
// for tracing services implemented with Go kit.
//
// We do not provide any Go kit specific code, as the other
// generic modules (apmhttp and apmgrpc) are sufficient.
//
// Go kit-based HTTP servers can be traced by instrumenting
// the kit/transport/http.Server with apmhttp.Wrap, and HTTP
// clients can be traced by providing a net/http.Client
// instrumented with apmhttp.WrapClient.
//
// Go kit-based gRPC servers and clients can both be wrapped
// using the interceptors provided in module/apmgrpc.
package apmgokit // import "go.elastic.co/apm/module/apmgokit"
